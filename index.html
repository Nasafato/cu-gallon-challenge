		<h4>1 billion people live off 1 gallon of water per day. Columbia Students on average use between 40 and 50. If you had only 1 gallon (4 liters) of water to use for an entire day, what would you do? Are you ready to challenge yourselves to find out?</h4><br>

		<h2>What is the Gallon Challenge?</h2>
		<p>Living in New York, it's easy to forget the importance of water conservancy, and the idea that others do not have access to clean water may seem too distant to understand.  The Columbia University Gallon Challenge seeks to make students aware of their water usage by challenging them to use one gallon for one day - just like a billion other people on earth do.  Water conservancy is an important issue, even in New York, and we desire to educate students on the way that their water usage impacts the world.  Water you waiting for?!  Visit our <a href="/participate">participate</a> page to find out how to take the challenge, and visit our <a href="/waterconservancy">water conservancy</a> page to learn about this issue.</p>

					<h3>In Partnership with the Columbia Watermark Initiative</h3>
					<p>The Columbia Watermark Initiative (CWI) is a campaign focused on monitoring and evaluating water use and efficiency in dormitories around Columbia’s campus. While a great deal of progress has been made on campus through recycling programs, energy efficiency initiatives, and the construction of new LEED certified buildings, little has been done to assess water use and management. We aim to make Columbia a leader in water sustainability by engaging our innovative and conscientious community to reduce water waste on campus.<br>
					In the first phase of the project, we are benchmarking water usage in the Furnald Dormitory in order to build a profile of the typical Columbia student’s water use. Using this information, we will encourage students to make more sustainable decisions and compel the university to invest in better infrastructure. After the pilot with Furnald we hope to expand to other dormitories, driving competitions to further reduce water waste.</p>

					<h3>With Support From the Columbia University Green Fund</h3>
					<p>The Green Fund is a $25,000 fund that provides support for student-led projects.  These projects will be directed toward improving sustainability on the Columbia University campuses.  The Green Fund committee looks to fund approximately four to six projects, at an average of $5,000 to $10,000 per project. The projects selected must directly contribute to the environmental sustainability of Columbia's operations, have a defined and measurable outcome, and include components that raise greater awareness of sustainability initiatives on campus. Additionally, students must plan for a formalized final report and presentation of their findings and/or results.</p>

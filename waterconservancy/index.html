        	<h5>Water Conservancy Tips</h5>
			<h3>In the Dorms</h3>
			<p>Turn water off when brushing your teeth and while shaving or washing your face. Turn it on when it’s time to rinse.</p>
			<p>Check for leaks: Report them to maintenance ASAP to avoid mildew and mold, and, of course, water waste.</p>
			<p>Take shorter showers: Americans use 1.2 trillions of gallons of water taking showers each year. Spend shower time cleaning yourself, not standing there zoning out.</p><br>
			<p>Only wash clothes when you have a full load: This shouldn’t be too hard for students who wait until the last minute to do laundry. Just make sure you have a full load, or else you’re wasting water and energy on a half load.</p><br>
			<p>Flush sparingly if you’re in a single: If you’ve got a lot of suitemates or just a bathroom down the hall, you’ll have to flush every time out of courtesy and personal hygiene. But if you’re in a single, wait until you have to do the Number 2 to flush.</p><br>
			<p>Don’t use the toilet for arbitrary flushes: Throw cigarette butts and bugs in the trash, instead of sacrificing the 5-7 gallons of water it takes to flush.</p>
			<p>Wash clothes in cold water: This saves energy and water.</p><br>
			<p>Turn off water while you wash your hair: If you need a longer shower, turn off water while you let shampoo or conditioner soak in.</p><br>
			<p>Take fewer showers: If you plan on working out, schedule your shower for after exercise instead of doubling up.</p><br>
			<p>Reuse towels: Don’t throw towels into the laundry after only using them once: they’re still clean.</p><br>
			<p>Wear your jeans again: Here’s another excuse to be lazy: you can wear your jeans a few times before washing them, too.</p><br>
			<br>
			<h3>Dining Hall and Kitchen</h3>
			<p>Consider water footprint: You’ve heard of carbon footprint, but did you know that foods have a water footprint scale, too? Lettuce and cabbage have a water footprint of 15-24 gallons, while beef’s is up to 2500-5000 gallons.</p><br>
			<p>Use one glass per day to drink from: If you’re just drinking water, use the same glass all day to reduce the need for washing.</p><br>
			<p>Fill up one plate only: Use as few plates and utensils as possible to cut down on dish washing later. Do you really need a separate plate for your mashed potatoes?</p><br>
			<p>Bring your own reusable glasses and bottles: Don’t use disposable cups, and minimize dish washing loads for the dining hall staff. Instead, bring your own thermos or cup to fill up on water or fountain drinks.</p><br>
			<br>
			<h3>Personal Awareness</h3>
			<p>Learn how to compost: It’s a life skill you can use to save water.</p><br>
			<p>Report leaks around campus and challenge yourself to be better about water usage.</p><br>
			<p>Turn water faucets off tightly: After washing your hands or working in a lab, turn the faucets off tightly, and wait a few seconds to see if there are any drips.</p><br>
			<p>Report leaks: Even if it’s not in your dorm, report leaky faucets, toilets, etc. Don’t expect someone else to do it.</p><br>
			<p>Get a conservation buddy: Work with your friend, significant other, or roommate to keep each other accountable.</p><br>
			<p>Write down all the ways you see people wasting water: Then check to see if you’re practicing the same dirty habits yourself.</p><br>
			<p>Turn off the water while washing your hands: You don’t need the water running while you lather up.</p><br>
			<p>Get others involved, too.</p><br>
			<p>Join national campaigns: Sign up with the EPA’s WaterSense campaign to find out about events and literature you can share on campus.<p><br>
			<p>Don’t contaminate water supplies: Don’t pour anything into water supplies, like chemicals or drugs into toilets.<p><br>
